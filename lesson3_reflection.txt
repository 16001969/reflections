Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-fork is to clone a repository from another person in github
clone is when you make a exact copy in your computer or from the servert to your computer
branches are different parts of a repository.
I will use fork for making a copy of a repository that is not from me.
clone to make a exact copy of a repository
branches to make different versions of my software

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-because you can return to that one, even if the code has been modified in the previous one
also you can continue working on the code and merge it later
